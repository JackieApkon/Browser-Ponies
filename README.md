# Browser-Ponies returns!
Reimplementation of Desktop Ponies in JavaScript

This repository is the continuation of the support to the Browser Ponies made entirely by me ;)

I'm fixing bugs, and adapting the application script to be compatible with the latest versions of the Desktop Ponies.
I'm also improving the graphical user interface.

This Browser Ponies is 100% compartible with my Google Chrome extension: Pony Chrome Mania. You can found more info here: https://github.com/JasminDreasond/Pony-Chrome-Mania
