# Browser-Ponies
Reimplementation of Desktop Ponies in JavaScript

This repository is the continuation of the support to the Browser Ponies made entirely by me ;)

I'm fixing bugs, and adapting the application script to be compatible with the latest versions of Desktop Ponies.
I'm also improving the graphical user interface.
